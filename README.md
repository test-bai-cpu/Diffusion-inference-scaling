# Inference-time Scaling of Diffusion Models through Classical Search

## Overview

This repository provides the implementation of [**Inference-time Scaling of Diffusion Models through Classical Search**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23614). The approach leverages classical search algorithms to scale inference compute in diffusion models, improving efficiency and output quality.

## Implementation
The `imagenet` folder provides the implementation of BFS and double-verifier for class-conditional image generation, the `locomotion` folder provides the Q-verifier test-time search for offline RL tasks, the `text_to_image` folder contains the BFS ablations, and the `pointmaze` folder provides the implementation of the long-horizon planning task. For installation of each task, refer to the instructions in each subfolder.
